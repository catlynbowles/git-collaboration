# Hang In There

This partner project was completed as a part of the Turing Front End Development program. The goal of the project was to achieve various aspects of functionality within a motivational poster site, including:

1. A randomly selected poster is displayed upon page load.
2. When a user clicks the 'Show Random Poster' button, a new random poster is displayed.
3. Users have access to a 'Make Your Own Poster' function, which allows them to create and save their selected images, quotes and titles to new posters.
4. Saved posters, both randomly selected and user created,  can be displayed and deleted on the 'View My Saved Posters' function.
5. The user can move between the three main views through button clicks.
